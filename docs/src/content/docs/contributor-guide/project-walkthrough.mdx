The Playground's home page is a list of the `Showcases` available.

A `Showcase` is a page where we can tinker with a defined scenario for the Mingle. They are defined in `app/Showcases.php`:

We might want to add one, for a new feature. We should then add a Showcase, and a description.

This will add an entry to the welcome and allow contributors to have an overview with context.

```php
    // ...

    new Showcase(
        title: 'React Simple',
        description: 'A simple "Hello World" example.',
        routeName: 'react-simple',
    ),

    // ....
```
